# Circuit implementing the fhn neuron.

- The circuits in the schematics implement the FHN neuron described.
- The FHN neuron is an implementation of the circuit described in (Ribar, L. (2019). Synthesis of neuromorphic circuits with neuromodulatory properties [Apollo - University of Cambridge Repository]. https://doi.org/10.17863/CAM.53750). The OTA and CMFB are well known designs that can be found in textbooks.
